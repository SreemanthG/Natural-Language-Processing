One of the finer books I read this year was John Kaag’s Hiking With Nietzsche, in which Kaag, a professor of philosophy, rekindles his passion for the German thinker while tracing picturesque hiking trails in the mountains of Switzerland. It’s a near precise rendering of the travelogue as a self help book. A young kaag was an avowed Nietzsche acolyte but given the ravages of responsibilities and adulthood, the writer put his affinity to test by undertaking physically enduring hikes through the alps.
